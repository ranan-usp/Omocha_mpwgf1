# 10-Bit SAR ADC Project

## Overview
This project presents the design of a 10-bit Successive Approximation Register (SAR) Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) aimed at achieving high-precision analog-to-digital conversion. This SAR ADC is intended for digital signal processing applications where accurate conversion of analog signals into digital data is crucial.

## Circuit
To realize digital input and output capabilities, we integrated a 10-bit Capacitive Digital-to-Analog Converter (CDAC) circuit into the input stage. This CDAC circuit features precise capacitor matching and a low-noise design, essential for maximizing the performance of our SAR ADC.
